"""Process environment preparation, which must happen before LeRobot is imported.

Why this module exists
----------------------
``lerobot.policies.fastwam.modeling_fastwam`` sets ``DIFFSYNTH_MODEL_BASE_PATH`` at
*import* time via :func:`os.environ.setdefault`, pointing at a directory that will not
exist on your machine. ``setdefault`` is the saving grace: whoever writes the variable first wins. So as
long as we export our value before that module is imported, the upstream default never
takes effect and no patch to the pinned fork is needed.

The corollary is that importing LeRobot before calling :func:`prepare_environment` is a
silent misconfiguration -- FastWAM would look for Wan2.2 weights in a directory that does
not exist on this machine, and fail much later with an opaque model-hash error. So we
detect that ordering and refuse.
