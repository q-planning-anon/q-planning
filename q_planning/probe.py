"""``q-planning probe`` -- exercise the whole model stack without a simulator.

Loads the behaviour-cloning policy and the Q-function, synthesises one observation with the
shapes their configs declare, and runs a full planning step. That covers checkpoint loading,
the Wan2.2 base weights, the horizon agreement between the two models, candidate sampling,
the encoder amortisation, scoring and aggregation -- everything except the environment.

Worth having as its own command because the simulators are the hardest part of the install
and the slowest thing to fail. If this passes, a later failure is the environment's; if it
fails, there is no point debugging inside a simulator.

It also reports the spread of Q-values across candidates. A spread of ~0 means the
Q-function is returning a constant, the weighted average degenerates to a plain mean, and
value guidance is silently doing nothing -- a failure that a success rate would hide.
