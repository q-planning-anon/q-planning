"""The growing replay buffer of deployment rollouts.

Rollouts are written as LeRobot datasets, one directory per iteration (and per shard), and
read back lazily. The buffer is cumulative: iteration N trains on everything collected up to
N, not just the newest batch, which is what lets the Q-function keep the earlier failure
modes in view instead of forgetting them.

Both successful and failed episodes are kept. That asymmetry is the point of the method -- a
behaviour-cloning policy could only learn from the successes, while a value function learns
from a failure too, because a failed episode is simply one whose return is zero.
