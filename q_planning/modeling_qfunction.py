"""The Q-function model, plus the one loading helper the fork does not provide.

``QFunctionPolicy`` is re-exported from the pinned LeRobot fork -- see
:mod:`q_planning.configuration_qfunction` for why the model is not redeclared here.

Architecture: a DINOv2 visual encoder and a T5 text encoder, both parameter-disjoint from
the policy, feed a transformer decoder that cross-attends to the observation tokens while
taking the candidate action chunk as query tokens. The head emits ``num_bins`` logits over a
grid of return values, and the scalar Q is the expectation under their softmax -- that
expectation is :func:`expected_value`.
