# Running a full evaluation

A complete comparison has three conditions per benchmark: the policy alone, the policy under
Q-guided selection, and the policy after self-improvement.

## Where each column comes from

The two Q-guided columns both come from a single self-improvement run. Each iteration rolls
out a **held-out block** whose seeds are fixed across iterations and which is never added to
the replay buffer. Iteration 0 measures the Q-function before any online updates; the final
iteration measures it after. Measuring this way means the two columns share a protocol
exactly and that no reported episode was ever trained on.

`configs/report.yaml` declares which files feed which column.

## Commands

```bash
# The unguided policy, per benchmark.
q-planning eval --config configs/libero_spatial/baseline.yaml
q-planning eval --config configs/libero_object/baseline.yaml
q-planning eval --config configs/libero_goal/baseline.yaml
q-planning eval --config configs/libero_10/baseline.yaml
q-planning eval --config configs/robotwin/baseline.yaml

# Q-guided, before and after self-improvement.
q-planning self-improve --config configs/libero_spatial/self_improve.yaml
# ... and so on

q-planning report --config configs/report.yaml --format latex
```

A standalone Q-guided evaluation is also available and is the cheaper way to try planner
settings without running a full loop:

```bash
q-planning eval --config configs/libero_10/q_planning_offline.yaml
```

## Sharding

RoboTwin's tasks are slow, and holding many simulators open exhausts host memory, so
collection is meant to be split across jobs:

```bash
for k in $(seq 0 15); do
  q-planning self-improve --config configs/robotwin/self_improve.yaml \
      --stage collect --eval.shard=$k/16
done
q-planning self-improve --config configs/robotwin/self_improve.yaml --stage finetune
```

Seeds derive from a task's index in the full task list, so a sharded run evaluates exactly
the episodes an unsharded one would.

If you chain these as scheduler jobs, make the update job depend on the collection jobs
**completing rather than succeeding**, and let the shard-coverage check decide whether there
is enough data. A dependency requiring success will strand the chain the first time a
preemptible job is preempted.

## A cheap smoke run first

```bash
q-planning eval --config configs/libero_10/q_planning_offline.yaml \
    --eval.episodes_per_task=2 --planner.n_samples=8 --benchmark.episode_length=60
```

Short episodes over a few tasks. It will not produce a meaningful success rate, but it
exercises the same path end to end.

## What a small run can and cannot tell you

Cheap runs detect breakage, not effect sizes. Differences between conditions are typically a
few percentage points, which is close to the binomial standard error at a couple of hundred
episodes per benchmark; a twenty-episode run cannot resolve them. Use the episode counts in
the configs when the number matters.
